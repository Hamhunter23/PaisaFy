## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- Enable 2FA on your Alpaca account

### Trading Risks
- This bot trades with real money when live trading is enabled
- Always test thoroughly with paper trading first
- Monitor positions regularly, especially during high volatility
- Understand that past performance doesn't guarantee future results

### Technical Considerations
- FinBERT requires significant computational resources
- GPU acceleration recommended for faster sentiment analysis and DRL training
- DRL model training can take several hours depending on hardware
- Ensure stable internet connection for real-time trading
- Monitor API rate limits to avoid service interruptions
- TensorBoard logs and trained models are safe for version control (no sensitive data)
